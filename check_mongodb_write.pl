$DESCRIPTION = "Nagios Plugin to check MongoDB via API by writing a unique document and then reading it back

It will find and connect to the Primary from the given list of Mongod / Mongos nodes. Failing to find a viable Primary will result in the whole check aborting as the replica set / cluster is non-writable in that scenario.

Once it connects to the Primary, it will perform the following checks:

1. write a new unique document to the nagios collection with dynamically generated value
2. read the same document back, checking the value is identical to the value generated and written
3. delete the just created document
4. records the write/read/delete timings to a given precision and outputs perfdata for graphing
5. compares each operation's time taken against the warning/critical thresholds if given

Tested on MongoDB 2.4.8, 2.6.1, 3.2.1 - standalone mongod, mongod Replica Sets, mongos with Sharded Replica Sets, with and without authentication

Write concern and Read concern take the following options with --write-concern and --read-concern:

'1'         = primary only
'2'         = primary + 1 secondary replica
'N'         = N number of Mongod instances must acknowledge including Primary
'majority'

The query timeout for each write => read => delete operation is one quarter of the global --timeout

MongoDB Library Limitations:

- Error Handling: the MongoDB Perl library has some limitations around the way it handles exceptions and error reporting. As a result, connection problems and failure to find a master result in an incorrect error message 'Operation now in progress' if attempting to handle and prefix with CRITICAL, so they have been left bare to report the correct errors. The correct Nagios error code of CRITICAL (2) is still enforced via the library HariSekhonUtils regardless
  - Specifying a list of nodes in a Replica Set where none of the nodes are Primary results in 'not master at check_mongodb_write.pl ...'
- Write Concern:
    - Using write concern 'all' is not supported, it should work in theory according to the library documentation but in reality it does not work so has been disallowed as an option
    - Using anything other than 1 with a stand alone Mongod causes results in 'repl at check_mongodb_write.pl line 221'. This is unintuitive but basically means there is no replication / Replica Set for the value to be valid
    - Because of these behaviours, the write concern is set to 'majority' if more than one node is specified and '1' otherwise. This can be overridden using --write-concern
    - Using a write-concern higher than the number of members of a Replica Set will result in a timeout error from the library (wtimeout which defaults to 1 second)
