monitoring-plugins-common  # newer deb distros, not available on Ubuntu 14.04
nagios-plugins-common      # older deb distros, sometimes installs monitoring-plugins-common on newer systems, other times not found

# =====================================
# for check_whois.pl - looks like this has been removed from repos :-/
jwhois

# needed to build perl's DBD::mysql and python's MySQL-python
#
# Ubuntu 12 Precise which is still used in Travis CI uses libmysqlclient-dev, but Debian 9 Stretch and Ubuntu 16 Xenial
# use libmariadbd-dev so this must now be handled separately in Makefile to try installing
# libmariadbd-dev and if failing then try falling back to libmysqlclient-dev
# included from perl library
#libmariadbd-dev
#libmysqlclient-dev
#libmariadb-dev-compat

# for Ubuntu builds otherwise autoremove in docker removes this so mysql python library doesn't work
libmariadbclient18
