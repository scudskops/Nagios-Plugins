Nagios Plugin to check all mount points listed in /etc/fstab are mounted

The mount points from fstab are checked against /proc/mounts

Does not use the 'mount' command because this can be outdated mtab information

This will catch disks that fail to mount or are not currently mounted, which often causes applications to end up writing to and filling up the root filesystem

Tested on CentOS 7
