Nagios utils.pm plugins
=======================

These plugins currently use the standard Nagios utils.pm library. At some point they will be reintegrated to use my better personal library and move to top level.

There are also several other older plugins not using Nagios utils.pm (mainly because they're written in Python or VBS for Windows) that are found under the ../older directory.
