"""

Nagios Plugin to check the current number of Presto tasks on a Presto Coordinator or Worker node via its API

Warning / Critical thresholds apply to the number of current tasks and it also outputs
graph perfdata of the number of tasks and query time to retrieve this information

This isn't efficent at all as it must get the full list of tasks from the node with their detailed information
(which can be quite large) and parse for non-completed states as the Presto API doesn't expose this
summary information anywhere that I can see (please let me know and I'll write an update if this changes),
but this plugin still completes in 500ms including parsing time

Significant task history may cause this plugin to take longer to return, so watch the graph
on query time from the perfdata that is output

Tested on:

- Presto Facebook versions:               0.152, 0.157, 0.167, 0.179, 0.185, 0.186, 0.187, 0.188, 0.189
- Presto Teradata distribution versions:  0.152, 0.157, 0.167, 0.179
- back tested against all Facebook Presto releases 0.69, 0.71 - 0.189
  (see Presto docker images on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon)
